lost 3 chess games in a row and thought i'd make an opening trainer.

in my view, opening trainers do these things:

1. sell courses
2. spaced repetition on lines from your repertoire

i was like "haha, that's easy" and vibecoded this bullshit.

## what i learned

when llm finished vibecoding this i looked at the result and thought: "fuck i will never use this".

the core offering of opening trainers (as i see them) sounds boring because it is. i know it's easy to just know the best move, but i want to be the kind of player that understands what's going on—not one who's memorized a ton of lines.

so this is going on the pile.
